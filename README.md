For this project, we are attempting to build our own BB-8 as seen in the Star Wars Episode VII. He is a rolling droid with a head that can swivel around as he rolls, without falling off. 

To accomplish this, we used the following hardware...
```
Raspberry Pi 2 B+
2 DC gear motors + wheels
3 servos for head control
Old 12" Globe (main body) //We are working on getting a 3D printed body. Currently designing it.
Strong Magnets
Ball Bearing Casters
Foam Hemisphere for the head
Other Structural pieces of your choice (Ex// K'NEX or popsicle sticks)
Other Items for Decoration
Paint of your choice
```
We used [this](http://i.imgur.com/IKulixk.jpg) chassis and motor combo.
