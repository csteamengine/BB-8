For this project, we are attempting to build our own BB-8 as seen in the Star Wars Episode VII. He is a rolling droid with a head that can swivel around as he rolls, without falling off. 

To accomplish this, we used the following hardware...
```
Raspberry Pi 2 B+
2 DC gear motors + wheels
3 servos for head control
Old 12" Globe (main body)
Strong Magnets
Ball Bearing Casters
Foam Hemisphere for the head
Other Structural pieces of your choice (Ex// K'NEX or popsicle sticks)
Other Items for Decoration
Paint of your choice
```
We used [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GLO5SMY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_act_title_1&smid=A3P9EAC3KD93H7) chassis and motor combo.
